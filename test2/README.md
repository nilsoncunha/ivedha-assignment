# Test2

I tried to perform this test2, but I don't have much experience with Ansible, which made it more difficult to execute.
I couldn't run the containers to simulate the hosts. I attempted to use RHEL images, but they required login credentials, which I believe would make it harder for someone else to run the tests.
I ran a CentOS image and made some configurations since CentOS 7 doesn’t come with ansible pre-installed. However, even after that, when I tried to run the inventory.ini, I encountered error messages.

Since I’m out of time, I decided to submit the test as it is, as test1 and test3 were successfully completed, in my view.

Thank you so much
